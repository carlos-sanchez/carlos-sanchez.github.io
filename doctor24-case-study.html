  <h1>Doctor24 Case Study: From MVP to Scheduled Calls</h1>

  <h2>Context</h2>

  <p>Doctor24 began as a simple telemedicine service, connecting users with doctors via online video calls. The concept was straightforward: log in, click, and consult a physician from anywhere.</p>

  <figure>

  </figure>

  <p>Traditional doctor visits demand time and effort, often leading people to self-medicate or delay care. Yet, prevention beats cure—both for health and cost. We asked: how can we bridge the gap between patients and doctors? Our hypothesis: if connecting with a doctor is effortless and instant, people will seek medical advice more often.</p>

  <h2>The MVP</h2>

  <p>In healthcare, you can’t rush and risk errors—sensitive data and legal compliance are non-negotiable. To test our hypothesis quickly yet safely, we built a lean, law-compliant web app for unscheduled video calls with primary care physicians.</p>

  <p><strong>Why a web app?</strong> It was the fastest way to create a unified platform for patients and doctors.</p>

  <p><strong>Why unscheduled calls?</strong> Scheduling adds layers of complexity—more on that later.</p>

  <p><strong>Why primary care physicians?</strong> A small team could address most common medical issues efficiently.</p>

  <p>The MVP aimed to answer key questions:</p>

  <ul>
      <li>Are Spaniards ready for telemedicine?</li>
      <li>What share of medical issues can video calls resolve?</li>
      <li>What problems will users bring to the service?</li>
      <li>Do users prioritize speed or doctor choice?</li>
      <li>What’s an acceptable wait time?</li>
      <li>Will users sign up proactively or only when sick?</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>MVP Challenges</h2>

  </figure>

  <p>Video calls on platforms like Hangouts or Skype are prone to glitches. Add a medical consultation—complete with patient input, diagnosis, treatment, and billing—and complexity soars. We controlled the doctors’ internet stability, but patient-side disruptions were common. Here’s what we learned about user expectations:</p>

  <ul>
      <li>Patients wanted to resume calls with the same doctor.</li>
      <li>They hated repeating their medical history.</li>
      <li>Doctors dreaded redoing diagnoses or prescriptions.</li>
      <li>Failed calls shouldn’t clutter medical records—patients just wanted solutions.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The MVP offered no doctor selection—just a “Talk to a doctor now” button. Interrupted calls couldn’t reconnect instantly, but with often just one doctor online, patients usually got the same physician on retry. When all doctors were busy, we showed an estimated wait time and queued patients in a virtual waiting room.</p>

  <h2>The Pilot</h2>

  <p>In Spain, doctor visits cost companies €330 per employee annually. We pitched Doctor24 as a B2B perk—saving employees time and employers money. A three-month pilot with a pharmaceutical company gave all their Spanish staff access. Key findings emerged:</p>

  <ul>
      <li>Users accurately judged which issues suited video calls—doctors resolved 83% of cases.</li>
      <li>Skepticism faded after the first try.</li>
      <li>Follow-ups with the same doctor were in demand.</li>
      <li>Recurrent users valued familiarity but loved instant access too.</li>
      <li>Chat worked as a fallback when video failed—hinting a simpler MVP might’ve sufficed.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The pilot confirmed Doctor24’s value: it solved real problems, and patients embraced it. Next, we’d commercialize to test product/market fit while addressing pilot feedback. We pivoted to support two use cases:</p>

  <ul>
      <li>Instant doctor access for emergencies and new users.</li>
      <li>Follow-ups with a preferred doctor for recurring patients.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Scheduled Calls</h2>

  <p>Post-pilot, we tackled scheduled calls to fix MVP flaws. The plan: connect instantly if your doctor’s free; otherwise, pick another physician or book a slot. This also solved reconnection woes after dropped calls.</p>

  <h2>Scheduled Calls Challenges</h2>

  <p>Unscheduled calls kept the MVP simple—scheduling upends that. Consider:</p>

  <ul>
      <li>Setting medical shifts.</li>
      <li>Ensuring doctors log in on time.</li>
      <li>Defining time slots.</li>
      <li>Managing overlaps.</li>
      <li>Tracking and reminding about appointments.</li>
      <li>Handling cancellations.</li>
      <li>Delaying virtual room access until the doctor’s ready.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>The Solution</h2>

  <p>Overlapping appointments proved tricky. Fixed slots clashed with fluid consultations—doctors couldn’t cut off patients mid-conversation. A doctor-only timer showed if another patient waited, letting them choose:</p>

  <ul>
      <li>Schedule a follow-up.</li>
      <li>Wrap up for the next patient.</li>
      <li>Continue if no one’s waiting.</li>
  </ul>

  </figure>

  <p>We started with 15-minute slots—adjustable based on data—and allowed bookings up to two minutes before a session. Interrupted calls? Easy reconnection. For “Talk to a doctor now,” we reserved unbooked slots, ensuring at least one doctor was always available unscheduled, while others handled appointments. This flexed for full- and part-time physicians.</p>

  <h2>The Results</h2>

  <p>Scheduled calls fixed MVP hiccups—reconnections included—while keeping the platform intuitive, despite added complexity. Scalability soared. But sales lagged. Users loved Doctor24; companies didn’t see enough value. We explored new pricing and a B2C pivot, but the service shut down. Would scheduled calls have won over businesses? We’ll never know.</p>

  <p>Product/market fit eluded us, yet Doctor24’s potential shone. Telemedicine’s future—where physical visits are rare, and prevention rules—feels inevitable. It’s cost-effective for providers and life-enhancing for patients.</p>
